    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Homemade tortillas are so much better that if you do decide to give these a try, be warned that you'll have a very hard time ever going back to the packaged option again.
    </p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable shortening</li>
        <li>½ cup hot water</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour for dusting</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
       <li><p>
        Whisk flour, salt, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Add vegetable shortening and work into flour mixture using a pastry cutter until it resembles coarse crumbs.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
        Form a well in the middle of flour mixture and mix in hot water. Work flour and water mixture together with a fork and transfer to a cutting board.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
        Knead until a smooth, soft dough is formed, about 3 minutes. Add more flour if dough is too sticky.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
        Place more flour on cutting board, cover dough with bowl, and let rest for 15 minutes.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
        Cut ball of dough into eight equal parts and cover until needed.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
        Roll out balls of dough either by hand or with a tortilla press.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place flattened tortilla in skillet and cook until it begins to bubble, about 1 minute. Flip tortilla over and cook for an additional minute. Flip again and cook for 1 more minute. Repeat with remaining dough.
        </p></li>
